title: Fork my second brain
---
Welcome to my second brain—a living, breathing experiment where ideas run wild, mistakes are celebrated, and relearning is the ultimate superpower. 🧠✨

I’m Neil Riego, but you can call me scaredmeow (my cats insist). This is my playground, my digital sandbox, where I’m rediscovering everything from scratch as part of my 2025 "do-it-loud" journey. It’s messy, experimental, and oh-so-human—because growth isn’t always polished, right?

Think of this as my mental adventure log. You’ll find me diving deep into Python wizardry, automating my way to glory, geeking out over data science, and juggling tech experiments like a caffeinated circus cat. Alongside all the code and curiosity, there’s a sprinkle of gaming nostalgia, cat wisdom, and chaotic good energy.

Here, nothing’s off-limits. Half-baked ideas? Yup. Random “aha” moments? Absolutely. Projects where I question all my life choices? Oh, you bet.

I’m relearning how to build, connect, and embrace the glorious chaos of creativity. Whether you’re here to share in the journey or just peek into the madness, grab some catnip, get comfy, and let’s make some meowgic happen. 🐾✨
