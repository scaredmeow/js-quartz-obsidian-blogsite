### Colorful Highlights



In ==**Blue Topaz**== theme, there are three colorful highlights  `*==Text here==*`, `**==text here==**`, and  `***==text here==***` 


| Appearances           | What you put in your text       |
| :-------------------: | :--------------: |
| *==Hello World==*     | \*\=\=Hello World\=\=\*         |
| **==Hello World==**   | \*\*\=\=Hello World\=\=\*\*     |
| ***==Hello World==*** | \*\*\*\=\=Hello World\=\=\*\*\* |

```ad-summary
Even if you disabled the colorful highlights in the **Style Settings 2.1.4**, you can still make it active in your very specific note by adding `cssclass: colorful-highlight`  into the notes YAML

Please keep in mind, in ==**Live Preview**== mode, it **DOES NOT** tell the difference of order of codes `"*==Text Here==*"` from `"==*Text Here*=="`.  However, it will be distingushed in ==**Reading**== mode, so, only text begin with a **\* ** shall be rendered  as colorful highlight text.
