## Images in Your Notes

### Center Your Images
By default, when you put an image file in your notes with **\!\[\[ImageFileName\]\]**, the image is centered as shown below.  **Left Click** inside the image  will  **Zoom In** it.

![[obsidian_image.png]]
### Left or Right Alignment Your Images
If you would like to `left or right alignment`  your image, simple add ==**\|LEFT\|left\|Left\|L\|RIGHT\|right\|Right\|R**== after your **ImageFileName** like  **\!\[\[ImageFileName |R \]\]** ,  the `|` to separate your **ImageFileName** , and the `R`  will `right aligment` your image.

Example: Right alignment of the image with `![[obsidian_image.png|R]]` you have,
![[obsidian_image.png|R|120]]

Example: Left alignment of the image `![[obsidian_image.png|L]]` you have,
![[obsidian_image.png|L|120]]

### Sizing Your Images While Left and Right Alignment

Above examples do not show too many differences, that's because the images are too big. Let's make it smaller by 
 simple adding ==**\|DigitalNumber**== after your **ImageFileName** and **left or right** command üòä, like  **\!\[\[ImageFileName \|R\|120 \]\]** , the `|` to separate your **ImageFileName** , **Left or Right** , while the number `120` is the size of the image.  If you have no ideas what the size is of the image, try 2 or 3 times, you will get it.üòä

`![[obsidian_image.png|R|120]]` as an example,
![[obsidian_image.png|R|150]]
`![[obsidian_image.png|L|120]]` as another example,
![[obsidian_image.png|L|150]]


`left`/`Left`/`LEFT`/`L`
![[obsidian_image.png|L|100]]
![[obsidian_image.png|Left|100]]

`right`/`Right`/`RIGHT`/`R`
![[obsidian_image.png|RIGHT|100]]
![[obsidian_image.png|right|100]]

### Using `![]()` to Embed Images to Notes
As for the images been embedded in notes with `![]()` can also be manipulated in the same way above described. Splitting the pane left-and-right if the images are not shown up immediately, then it will show well. (This is due to  Obsidian's limitation)

#### Zoon in and Out
This shows the zooming apperences of embedded image with `![]()`
`![|300](obsidian_image.png)` ![|300](obsidian_image.png)
#### Left or Right Alignment
Examples of left or right alignment with `![]()` embedded images:
All these writings `right`/`Right`/`RIGHT`/`R` and `left`/`Left`/`LEFT`/`L` will do as your expecting. üòä

**The Blue Topaz theme of Obsidian is the best theme of mime, I believe.** *The Blue Topaz theme of Obsidian is the best theme of mime, I believe.* **==The Blue Topaz theme of Obsidian is the best theme of mine, I believe.==** *==The Blue Topaz theme of Obsidian is the best theme of mime, I believe.==* ***==The Blue Topaz theme of Obsidian is the best theme of mime, I believe.==***


####  Images Inline Left and Right Alignment
With `codes` like `inlineR`/`InlineR`/`INLINER`/`inlR`  (for `right aligment`) and  `inlineL`/`InlineL`/`INLINEL`/`inlL` (for `left alignment`) will insert the images in lines in your notes.

```ad-example

**The Blue Topaz theme of Obsidian is the best theme of mime, I believe.** *The Blue Topaz theme of Obsidian is the best theme of mime, I believe.* **==The Blue Topaz theme of Obsidian is the best theme of mine, I believe.==** *==The Blue Topaz theme of Obsidian is the best theme of mime, I believe.==* ***==The Blue Topaz theme of Obsidian is the best theme of mime, I believe.==*** ![|inlineR|80](obsidian_image.png)***==The Blue Topaz theme of Obsidian is the best theme of mime, I believe.==*** 
![|inlL|100](obsidian_image.png)
**The Blue Topaz theme of Obsidian is the best theme of mime, I believe.** *The Blue Topaz theme of Obsidian is the best theme of mime, I believe.* **==The Blue Topaz theme of Obsidian is the best theme of mine, I believe.==** *==The Blue Topaz theme of Obsidian is the best theme of mime, I believe.==* ***==The Blue Topaz theme of Obsidian is the best theme of mime, I believe.==***
```


#### Images Aside Inline with varied Size
 With `codes` like `inl|ImageSize` will insert the images with varied size in lines in your notes.

Code shall look like this :  `![|inl|50](ImangeFileName)` or `![|inl|50](https//xxxxxxx.png)` where the `50` indicates the size of the images, it can be varied. (Oh, forgot to mention it, it is in pixels üòä)

```ad-example

![|inl|50](obsidian_image.png) I love the Blue Topaz!Blue Topaz![|inl|60](obsidian_image.png) ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏èThe Blue Topaz‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è![|inl|70](obsidian_image.png) ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è![|inl|80](obsidian_image.png)I ‚ù§Ô∏è Blue Topaz!**The Blue Topaz theme of Obsidian is the best theme of mime, I believe.** *The Blue Topaz theme of Obsidian is the best theme of mime, I believe.* **==The Blue Topaz theme of Obsidian is the best theme of mine, I believe.==** *==The Blue Topaz theme of Obsidian is the best theme of mime, I believe.==* ***==The Blue Topaz theme of Obsidian is the best theme of mime, I believe.==***
```

***==The Blue Topaz theme of Obsidian is the best theme of mime, I believe.==*** **==The Blue Topaz theme of Obsidian is the best theme of mime, I believe.==**


** Here is the `![]()`  code.** , Please pay attention to the image only.
***==The Blue Topaz theme of Obsidian is the best theme of mime, I believe.==*** **==The Blue Topaz theme of Obsidian is the best theme of mime, I believe.==**  ![|inl|50](obsidian_image.png) ==The Blue Topaz theme of Obsidian is the best theme of mime, I believe.== **The Blue Topaz theme of Obsidian is the best theme of mime, I believe.** ***The Blue Topaz theme of Obsidian is the best theme of mime, I believe.*** ***==The Blue Topaz theme of Obsidian is the best theme of mime, I believe.==*** **==The Blue Topaz theme of Obsidian is the best theme of mime, I believe. ==***==The Blue Topaz theme of Obsidian is the best theme of mime, I believe.==* **The Blue Topaz theme of Obsidian is the best theme of mime, I believe.** ***The Blue Topaz theme of Obsidian is the best theme of mime, I believe.***

When `inlR/inlL` and `inl` are used, its **positions** inline will have some sutle influnces to the resaults. See below examples. 

For `inlR` and `inlL`Ôºåthe image will aglin with the top of the line where it is in, while for `inl`, the image will aglin with the bottom of the line.

### Title of Images
*Adopted from  Obsidian Themes of Discordian and Orange by @radekkozak and @echoxu*

Put `#centre` / `#center`,`#right` or `#left` after `ImageFileName`, like `![[xxx.png#position|captions|size]]`

![[obsidian_image.png#center|Figure 1. Is this an egg?|100]]

#### Inline Continuous Images  with Titles
Put code `#inl` in.

You input texts like 
`![[obsidian_image.png#inl|Figure 1. This is an egg!|200]]![[obsidian_image.png#inl|Figure 2. This is NOT an egg!|100]]![[obsidian_image.png#inl|Figure 3. Is this an egg?|150]]![[obsidian_image.png#inl|Figure 4. This is Obsidian|100]]`

It shows below! You may need to maximum widen your screen to see what is looks like.
![[obsidian_image.png#inl|Figure 1. This is an egg!|200]]![[obsidian_image.png#inl|Figure 2. This is NOT an egg!|100]]![[obsidian_image.png#inl|Figure 3. Is this an egg?|150]]![[obsidian_image.png#inl|Figure 4. This is an Obsidian.|100]]

```ad-tips
Positions also needs to be considered when you use these codes.
```
### Images in One Row
#### Method One

**ImageFileName +** `|inline` or **ImageFileName +** `|inline|number`, where `number` indicates image sizes, it could be varied.  

For example:

`![[obsidian_image.png|inl|100]]![[obsidian_image.png|inline|100]] ![[obsidian_image.png|INLINE|100]]![[obsidian_image.png|inl|100]] ![[obsidian_image.png|inline|100]]`

Above texts will show as below:

![[obsidian_image.png|inl|100]]![[obsidian_image.png|inline|100]] ![[obsidian_image.png|INLINE|100]]![[obsidian_image.png|inl|100]] ![[obsidian_image.png|inline|100]]

#### Method Two
**ImageFileName +** `|+grid`, the image size will be adjusted automatically or separately.
`![[ImageFileName|+grid]]`

You input texts like 

`![[obsidian_image.png|+grid]]![[obsidian_image.png|+grid]]![[obsidian_image.png|+grid]]![[obsidian_image.png|+grid]]

`![[obsidian_image.png|+grid]]![[obsidian_image.png|+grid]]![[obsidian_image.png|+grid]]`

`![[obsidian_image.png|+grid|100]]![[obsidian_image.png|+grid|100]]![[obsidian_image.png|+grid|100]]![[obsidian_image.png|+grid|100]]`

`![[obsidian_image.png|+grid|50]]![[obsidian_image.png|+grid|50]]`

It shows below! You may need to maximum widen your screen to see what is looks like.

![[obsidian_image.png|+grid]]![[obsidian_image.png|+grid]]![[obsidian_image.png|+grid]]![[obsidian_image.png|+grid]]

![[obsidian_image.png|+grid]]![[obsidian_image.png|+grid]]![[obsidian_image.png|+grid]]

![[obsidian_image.png|+grid|100]]![[obsidian_image.png|+grid|100]]![[obsidian_image.png|+grid|100]]![[obsidian_image.png|+grid|100]]

![[obsidian_image.png|+grid|50]]![[obsidian_image.png|+grid|50]]


#### Method Three
Put `cssClass: img-grid` in your note's `YAML` area like below.

```yaml
---
cssclass: img-grid
---
```
