### Using Admonition Plugin `ad-kanban`
```ad-kanban

- [ ] This is a purple egg.
	- [ ] Actually, the Obsidian is a purple egg.
	- [ ] Keep on this saying, they will believe it finally.
	- [ ] Do not tell the truths.
- [ ] Believe or not, actually, it is a duck egg.
	- [ ] Too crue to believe.
	- [ ] Can't to see it barely.
- [ ] It is a joke, it realy is an egg.
	- [ ] Believe or not, your call.
	- [ ] Believe it is an egg, make you live for ever!
- It is OK without `Checkbox`
	- It does not matter whether it is an egg or not.
	- Ordered list can not use this `Pseudo Kanban`!
	- [[Start From Here EN|Start form Here]]
- Psedo Kanban supports four or more columns table
	- To change four columns into five colums 如果想把四列变成支持五列换行
	- flex: 1 1 20%; 
	- Change it to flex: 1 1 18%;
- Columns more than four will adapt the width automatically
	- Change the percentage of the `flex`
	- Customize columns numbers
1. Due to no settings for the ordered lists, so
	1. Pseudo kanban **DO NOT** supports `Ordered List`
	2. Pseudo kanban just more plain tables
```
